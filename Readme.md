# siteChecker

This app uses duckduckgo to do searches and then checks the sites it finds against virustotal. 
If the program finds any positives it prints the links to the console and writes them to a file.
This is the non-user input version. It does every possible combination of input for 100 characters.

# Why did I add this to the program instead of just staying with user input?

I did so because of how limited the results are from the DuckDuckGo API and given the purpose of the program
it felt was right to check as many inputs as possible.

# What purpose am I referring to?

To scan the internet for sites with viruses. I personally wish search engines would do the same and remove any sites with viruses from their search results and re-add them if and when they have been cleaned by their owners.

# Note to Employers

The virusTotal API requires a key in order to use the API. Please email me if you want it.
